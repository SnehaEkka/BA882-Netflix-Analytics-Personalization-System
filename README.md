# Netflix Content Recommendation System
### **Coursework: Deploying Analytics Pipeline**

![](https://github.com/SnehaEkka/BA882-Netflix-Analytics-Pipeline/blob/main/Images/netflix-banner.jpg)

A repository for a team project on "Deploying Analytics Pipelines" that involves three phases:
- Phase 1: Data Ops (ETL/ELT and Warehousing)
- Phase 2: ML Ops
- Phase 3: LLM Ops

## üìå Project Overview
### Motivation
With the rise of streaming platforms, content recommendation has become crucial for improving user experience. This project focuses on enhancing Netflix's recommendation system by integrating Machine Learning (ML) techniques with Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide more personalized and data-driven recommendations.

### Business Problem
Netflix offers a vast content catalog, making it difficult for users to discover new shows and movies. Traditional recommendation systems rely on watch history, but our approach extends beyond that by leveraging content metadata and user feedback. We aim to develop a hybrid recommendation engine that improves content discoverability and engagement.

### Data Sources
Our project incorporates multiple data feeds:
- **Netflix Top 10 Weekly Data** ‚Äì Provides insights into trending content. \

- **Netflix API Data** ‚Äì Contains metadata about Netflix content. \
   *Link: https://rapidapi.com/movie-of-the-night-movie-of-the-night-default/api/streaming-availability*
- **YouTube API Data** ‚Äì Captures engagement metrics from trailers and promotional videos. \

## üöÄ Phase 1: Data Collection & Initial ETL
### Accomplishments
- **Data Extraction & Storage:**
  - Integrated Netflix, YouTube, and other datasets.
  - Stored data in **DuckDB via MotherDuck** for efficient querying.
- **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) Creation:**
  - Designed a schema to map relationships between datasets.

- **ETL Pipeline Development:**
  - Built an **EtLT** (Extract, Transform, Load, then Transform) pipeline.
  - Converted date formats and extracted relevant features from unstructured data.
- **Visualization with Superset:**
  - Created dashboards for analyzing viewership trends.

### Challenges & Solutions
- **Data Inconsistencies:** Some datasets lacked unique identifiers, requiring fuzzy matching techniques.
- **Storage Optimization:** Transitioned from CSV-based storage to **MotherDuck** for better scalability.

## üîÑ Phase 2: Enhancing ETL & Building Machine Learning Models
### Accomplishments
- **ETL Optimization:**
  - Transitioned from **EtLT to ETL**, ensuring transformations occurred before loading.
  - Standardized title formatting to align across datasets.
- **Data Upsertion Strategy:**
  - Introduced **Insert Logic** to prevent missing historical records.
- **Machine Learning Model Development:**
  - Built a **KNN-based recommendation system** using cosine similarity.
  - Engineered features such as **cast, director, genre, and descriptions** for content similarity.
- **Prefect Pipeline Deployment:**
  - Automated daily ETL and model training flows using **Prefect Cloud**.

- **Dataset Expansion:**
  - Backfilled data for 2020-2021 to enhance model accuracy.

### Challenges & Solutions
- **Prefect Deployment Errors:** Fixed entrypoint issues by restructuring folders.
- **Feature Bias:** Removed runtime as a feature to prevent duration-based recommendations.
